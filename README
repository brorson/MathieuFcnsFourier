This directory contains an implementation of the
Mathieu fcns computed using the usual Fourier expansion method.  The
Fourier coeffs are found by creating a recursion matrix, then finding
its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  This is the method used by the
Northeastern REU students in Summer 2025.  Their paper is linked from
here:

I added golden value tests as well as fleshed out the implementations for
the radial fcns.  As time progresses I will do this:

*  Add functions returning the deriv of each fcn (in the angular or radial
   direction).
*  Add GV tests for the derivs.
*  Add modified Mathieu fcns of the second kind.
